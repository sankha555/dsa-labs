CHAPTER
Down
the
Alice
was
beginning
to
get
very
tired
of
sitting
by
her
sister
on
the
and
of
having
nothing
to
once
or
twice
she
had
peeped
into
the
book
her
sister
was
but
it
had
no
pictures
or
conversations
in
what
is
the
use
of
a
thought

pictures
or
So
she
was
considering
in
her
own
mind
well
as
she
for
the
hot
day
made
her
feel
very
sleepy
and
whether
the
pleasure
of
making
a
would
be
worth
the
trouble
of
getting
up
and
picking
the
when
suddenly
a
White
Rabbit
with
pink
eyes
ran
close
by
There
was
nothing
so
VERY
remarkable
in
nor
did
Alice
think
it
so
VERY
much
out
of
the
way
to
hear
the
Rabbit
say
to
Oh
I
shall
be
she
thought
it
over
it
occurred
to
her
that
she
ought
to
have
wondered
at
but
at
the
time
it
all
seemed
quite
but
when
the
Rabbit
actually
TOOK
A
WATCH
OUT
OF
ITS
and
looked
at
and
then
hurried
Alice
started
to
her
for
it
flashed
across
her
mind
that
she
had
never
before
seen
a
rabbit
with
either
a
or
a
watch
to
take
out
of
and
burning
with
she
ran
across
the
field
after
and
fortunately
was
just
in
time
to
see
it
pop
down
a
large
under
the
In
another
moment
down
went
Alice
after
never
once
considering
how
in
the
world
she
was
to
get
out
The
went
straight
on
like
a
tunnel
for
some
and
then
dipped
suddenly
so
suddenly
that
Alice
had
not
a
moment
to
think
about
stopping
herself
before
she
found
herself
falling
down
a
very
deep
Either
the
well
was
very
or
she
fell
very
for
she
had
plenty
of
time
as
she
went
down
to
look
about
her
and
to
wonder
what
was
going
to
happen
she
tried
to
look
down
and
make
out
what
she
was
coming
but
it
was
too
dark
to
see
then
she
looked
at
the
sides
of
the
and
noticed
that
they
were
filled
with
cupboards
and
here
and
there
she
saw
maps
and
pictures
hung
upon
She
took
down
a
jar
from
one
of
the
shelves
as
she
it
was
labelled
but
to
her
great
disappointment
it
was
she
did
not
like
to
drop
the
jar
for
fear
of
killing
so
managed
to
put
it
into
one
of
the
cupboards
as
she
fell
past
thought
Alice
to
such
a
fall
as
I
shall
think
nothing
of
tumbling
down
How
brave
all
think
me
at
I
say
anything
about
even
if
I
fell
off
the
top
of
the
was
very
likely
Would
the
fall
NEVER
come
to
an
wonder
how
many
miles

said

be
getting
somewhere
near
the
centre
of

Let

would
be
four
thousand
miles

you
Alice
had
learnt
several
things
of
this
sort
in
her
lessons
in
the
and
though
this
was
not
a
VERY
good
opportunity
for
showing
off
her
as
there
was
no
one
to
listen
to
still
it
was
good
practice
to
say
it
about
the
right
then
I
wonder
what
Latitude
or
Longitude
got

no
idea
what
Latitude
or
Longitude
but
thought
they
were
nice
grand
words
to
Presently
she
began

if
I

all

have
to

little
girl

I
shall

up
There
was
nothing
else
to
so
Alice
soon
began

And
here
Alice
began
to
get
rather
and
went
on
saying
to
in
a
dreamy
sort
of
cats
eat
Do
cats
eat
and
bats
eat
you
as
she
answer
either
it
much
matter
which
way
she
put
She
felt
that
she
was
dozing
and
had
just
begun
to
dream
that
she
was
walking
hand
in
hand
with
and
saying
to
her
very
tell
me
the

you
ever
eat
a
when
down
she
came
upon
a
heap
of
sticks
and
dry
and
the
fall
was
Alice
was
not
a
bit
and
she
jumped
up
on
to
her
feet
in
a
she
looked
but
it
was
all
dark
before
her
was
another
long
and
the
White
Rabbit
was
still
in
hurrying
down
There
was
not
a
moment
to
be
away
went
Alice
like
the
and
was
just
in
time
to
hear
it
as
it
turned
a
my
ears
and
how
late
She
was
close
behind
it
when
she
turned
the
but
the
Rabbit
was
no
longer
to
be
she
found
herself
in
a
low
which
was
lit
up
by
a
row
of
lamps
hanging
from
the
There
were
doors
all
round
the
but
they
were
all
and
when
Alice
had
been
all
the
way
down
one
side
and
up
the
trying
every
she
walked
sadly
down
the
wondering
how
she
was
ever
to
get
out
Suddenly
she
came
upon
a
little
all
made
of
solid
there
was
nothing
on
it
except
a
tiny
golden
and
first
thought
was
that
it
might
belong
to
one
of
the
doors
of
the
either
the
locks
were
too
or
the
key
was
too
but
at
any
rate
it
would
not
open
any
of
on
the
second
time
she
came
upon
a
low
curtain
she
had
not
noticed
and
behind
it
was
a
little
door
about
fifteen
inches
she
tried
the
little
golden
key
in
the
and
to
her
great
delight
it
Alice
opened
the
door
and
found
that
it
led
into
a
small
not
much
larger
than
a
she
knelt
down
and
looked
along
the
passage
into
the
loveliest
garden
you
ever
How
she
longed
to
get
out
of
that
dark
and
wander
about
among
those
beds
of
bright
flowers
and
those
cool
but
she
could
not
even
get
her
head
through
the
even
if
my
head
would
go
thought
poor
would
be
of
very
little
use
without
my
how
I
wish
I
could
shut
up
like
a
I
think
I
if
I
only
knew
how
to
you
so
many
things
had
happened
that
Alice
had
begun
to
think
that
very
few
things
indeed
were
really
There
seemed
to
be
no
use
in
waiting
by
the
little
so
she
went
back
to
the
half
hoping
she
might
find
another
key
on
or
at
any
rate
a
book
of
rules
for
shutting
people
up
like
this
time
she
found
a
little
bottle
on
certainly
was
not
here
said
and
round
the
neck
of
the
bottle
was
a
paper
with
the
words
beautifully
printed
on
it
in
large
It
was
all
very
well
to
say
but
the
wise
little
Alice
was
not
going
to
do
THAT
in
a
look
she
see
whether
marked
or
for
she
had
read
several
nice
little
histories
about
children
who
had
got
and
eaten
up
by
wild
beasts
and
other
unpleasant
all
because
they
WOULD
not
remember
the
simple
rules
their
friends
had
taught
such
that
a
poker
will
burn
you
if
you
hold
it
too
and
that
if
you
cut
your
finger
VERY
deeply
with
a
it
usually
and
she
had
never
forgotten
if
you
drink
much
from
a
bottle
marked
it
is
almost
certain
to
disagree
with
sooner
or
this
bottle
was
NOT
marked
so
Alice
ventured
to
taste
and
finding
it
very
in
a
sort
of
mixed
flavour
of
roast
and
hot
buttered
she
very
soon
finished
it
a
curious
said
must
be
shutting
up
like
a
And
so
it
was
she
was
now
only
ten
inches
and
her
face
brightened
up
at
the
thought
that
she
was
now
the
right
size
for
going
through
the
little
door
into
that
lovely
she
waited
for
a
few
minutes
to
see
if
she
was
going
to
shrink
any
she
felt
a
little
nervous
about
it
might
you
said
Alice
to
my
going
out
like
a
I
wonder
what
I
should
be
like
And
she
tried
to
fancy
what
the
flame
of
a
candle
is
like
after
the
candle
is
blown
for
she
could
not
remember
ever
having
seen
such
a
After
a
finding
that
nothing
more
she
decided
on
going
into
the
garden
at
alas
for
poor
when
she
got
to
the
she
found
she
had
forgotten
the
little
golden
and
when
she
went
back
to
the
table
for
she
found
she
could
not
possibly
reach
she
could
see
it
quite
plainly
through
the
and
she
tried
her
best
to
climb
up
one
of
the
legs
of
the
but
it
was
too
and
when
she
had
tired
herself
out
with
the
poor
little
thing
sat
down
and
no
use
in
crying
like
said
Alice
to
rather
advise
you
to
leave
off
this
She
generally
gave
herself
very
good
she
very
seldom
followed
and
sometimes
she
scolded
herself
so
severely
as
to
bring
tears
into
her
and
once
she
remembered
trying
to
box
her
own
ears
for
having
cheated
herself
in
a
game
of
croquet
she
was
playing
against
for
this
curious
child
was
very
fond
of
pretending
to
be
two
no
use
thought
poor
pretend
to
be
two
hardly
enough
of
me
left
to
make
ONE
respectable
Soon
her
eye
fell
on
a
little
glass
box
that
was
lying
under
the
she
opened
and
found
in
it
a
very
small
on
which
the
words
were
beautifully
marked
in
eat
said
if
it
makes
me
grow
I
can
reach
the
and
if
it
makes
me
grow
I
can
creep
under

way

into

I
care

She
ate
a
little
and
said
anxiously
to
Which
holding
her
hand
on
the
top
of
her
head
to
feel
which
way
it
was
and
she
was
quite
surprised
to
find
that
she
remained
the
same
to
be
this
generally
happens
when
one
eats
but
Alice
had
got
so
much
into
the
way
of
expecting
nothing
but
things
to
that
it
seemed
quite
dull
and
stupid
for
life
to
go
on
in
the
common
So
she
set
to
and
very
soon
finished
off
the
CHAPTER
The
Pool
of
Tears
and
cried
Alice
was
so
much
that
for
the
moment
she
quite
forgot
how
to
speak
good
opening
out
like
the
largest
telescope
that
ever
when
she
looked
down
at
her
they
seemed
to
be
almost
out
of
they
were
getting
so
far
my
poor
little
I
wonder
who
will
put
on
your
shoes
and
stockings
for
you
sure
be
I
shall
be
a
great
deal
too
far
off
to
trouble
myself
about
you
must
manage
the
best
way
you
I
must
be
kind
to
thought
perhaps
they
walk
the
way
I
want
to
Let
me
give
them
a
new
pair
of
boots

And
she
went
on
planning
to
herself
how
she
would
manage

go
by
the
she
how
funny
sending
presents
to
own
And
how
odd
the
directions

RIGHT
NEAR

Oh
what
nonsense
Just
then
her
head
struck
against
the
roof
of
the
in
fact
she
was
now
more
than
nine
feet
and
she
at
once
took
up
the
little
golden
key
and
hurried
off
to
the
garden
Poor
It
was
as
much
as
she
could
lying
down
on
one
to
look
through
into
the
garden
with
one
but
to
get
through
was
more
hopeless
than
she
sat
down
and
began
to
cry

to
be
ashamed
of

great
girl
like
might
well
say

on
crying
in
this
Stop
this
I
tell
But
she
went
on
all
the
shedding
gallons
of
until
there
was
a
large
pool
all
round
about
four
inches
deep
and
reaching
half
down

After
a
time
she
heard
a
little
pattering
of
feet
in
the
and
she
hastily
dried
her
eyes
to
see
what
was
It
was
the
White
Rabbit
splendidly
with
a
pair
of
white
kid
gloves
in
one
hand
and
a
large
fan
in

along

Alice
felt
so
desperate
that
she
was
ready
to
ask

The
Rabbit
started
dropped
the
white
kid

and

skurried

the
darkness
as
hard
as
he
could
Alice
took
up
the
fan
and
as
the
hall
was
very
she
kept
fanning
herself
all
the
time
she
went
on
How
queer
everything
is

And
she
began
thinking
over
all
the
children
she
knew
that
were
of
the
same
age
as
to
see
if
she
could
have
been
changed

she
crossed
her
hands
on
her
lap
as
if
she
were
saying
and
began
to
repeat
but
her
voice
sounded
hoarse
and
and
the
words

not

eyes

with
tears
again
as
she
went

be
Mabel
after
and
I
shall
have
to
go
and
live
in
that
poky
little
and
have
next
to
no
toys
to
play
and
ever
so
many
lessons
to
made
up
my
mind
about

their
heads
down
and

Tell

till
somebody

cried
with
a
sudden
burst
of
do
wish
they
WOULD
put
their
heads

am
so
VERY
tired
of
being
all
alone
As
she
said
this
she
looked
down
at
her
and
was
surprised
to
see
that
she
had
put
on
one
of
the
little
white
kid
gloves
while
she
was
CAN
I
have
done
she
must
be
growing
small
She
got
up
and
went
to
the
table
to
measure
herself
by
and
found
as
nearly
as
she
could
she
was
now
about
two
feet
and
was
going
on
shrinking
she
soon
found
out
that
the
cause
of
this
was
the
fan
she
was
and
she
dropped
it
just
in
time
to
avoid
shrinking
away
WAS
a
narrow
said
a
good
deal
frightened
at
the
sudden
but
very
glad
to
find
herself
still
in
now
for
the
and
she
ran
with
all
speed
back
to
the
little
the
little
door
was
shut

Just
then
she
heard
something
splashing
about
in

she
swam
nearer

make
out

it
at

she
thought
it
must
be

then
she
remembered
how

The

question
of

how
to

they
had
a
consultation
about
and
after
a
few

it
seemed
quite
natural
to
Alice
to
find

familiarly
with

By
this

she
had
found
her

into

she
had

fell
upon

stood
near

was
no

nevertheless
she
uncorked
it

put
it
to

to

said
to
I

just
see
what

I
do

It
did
so
and
much
sooner
than

found
her

pressing

it
was

went
on

and
very
soon
had
to
kneel
down
on

in
another
minute
there
was
not
even
room
for

she
tried
the
effect
of
lying
down
with
one
elbow
against
the
and
the
other
arm
curled
round
her
Still
she
went
on

she
put
one
arm
out
of

one
foot
up

said
to
herself

for

now
had
its

she

it
was
very
as
there
seemed
to
be
no

of
chance
of
her

she
felt

much
pleasanter

making
quite

after

waited
for
some
time
without

drew

Alice
called

as
loud
as
she

There
was
a
dead
silence
and
Alice
thought
to
wonder
what
they
WILL
do
If
they
had
any
take

roof
After
a
minute
or
they
began
moving
about
and
Alice
heard
the
Rabbit
barrowful
will
to
begin
barrowful
of
thought
but
she
had
not
long
to
for
the
next
moment
a
shower
of
little
pebbles
came
rattling
in
at
the
and
some
of
them
hit
her
in
the

a
stop
to

said
to
and
shouted

which
produced
another

Alice
noticed
with
some
surprise
that
the
pebbles
were
all
turning
into
little
cakes
as
they
lay
on
the
and
a
bright
idea
came
into
her
I
eat
one
of
these
she
sure
to
make
SOME
change
in
my
and
as
it
possibly

me
it

So
she
swallowed
one
of
the
and
was
delighted
to
find
that
she
began
shrinking
As
soon
as
she
was
small
enough
to
get
through
the
she
ran
out
of
the
and
found
quite
a
crowd
of
little
animals
and
birds
waiting
The
poor
little
was
in
the
being
held
up
by
two
who
were
giving
it
something

They
all
made
a
rush
at
Alice
the
moment
she

she
ran
off
as
hard
as
she

soon
found
herself
safe
in

Alice

thing
is

my
way
into

think
that

be
the
best
It
sounded
an
excellent
no
and
very
neatly
and
simply
the
only
difficulty
that
she
had
not
the
smallest
idea
how
to
set
about
and
while
she
was
peering
about
anxiously
among
the
a
little
sharp
bark
just
over
her
head
made
her
look
up
in
a
great
An
enormous
puppy
was
looking
down
at
her
with
large
round
and
feebly
stretching
out
one
trying
to
touch
little
said
in
a
coaxing
and
she
tried
hard
to
whistle
to
but
she
was
terribly
frightened
all
the
time
at
the
thought
that
it
might
be
in
which
case
it
would
be
very
likely
to
eat
her
up
in
spite
of
all
her
Hardly
knowing
what
she
she
picked
up
a
little
bit
of
and
held
it
out
to
the
whereupon
the
puppy
jumped
into
the
air
off
all
its
feet
at
with
a
yelp
of
and
rushed
at
the
and
made
believe
to
worry
then
Alice
dodged
behind
a
great
to
keep
herself
from
being
run
and
the
moment
she
appeared
on
the
other
the
puppy
made
another
rush
at
the
and
tumbled
head
over
heels
in
its
hurry
to
get
hold
of
then
thinking
it
was
very
like

a
game
of
play
with
a

expecting
every
moment
to
be
trampled
under
its

round
the
thistle
then
the
puppy
began
a
series
of
short
charges
at
the
running
a
very
little
way
forwards
each
time
and
a
long
way
and
barking
hoarsely
all

last
it
sat
down

good
way
with

This
seemed
to
Alice
a
good
opportunity
for
making
her
so
she
set
off
at
and
ran
till
she
was
quite
tired
and
out
of

till
the
bark
sounded
quite
faint
in
the

what
a
dear
little
puppy
it
said

against

Alice
looked
all
round
her
at
the
flowers
and

blades
of

she
did
not
see
anything
that

was
a

mushroom
growing
near
about

when
she
had
looked
under

on
both
sides
of

behind

occurred
to
her

stretched
herself
up
on

peeped
over

her
eyes
immediately
met
those
of

that
was
sitting
on

arms
quietly

Advice

at

for
a
trying

make
out

were
the
two
sides
of

as
it
was
perfectly
she
found
this
a
very
difficult
at
last
she
stretched
her
arms
round

as
far
as
they
would
and
broke
off
a
bit
of
the

a
little
of

the
next
moment
she
felt
a
violent
blow
underneath
her
it
had
struck
her
She
was
a
good
deal
frightened
by
this
very
sudden
but
she
felt
that
there
was
no
time
to
be
as
she
was
shrinking
so
she
set
to
work
at
once
to
eat
some

Her
chin
was
pressed
so
closely
against
her
that
there
was
hardly

managed
to

morsel

Alice
in
a
tone
of
which
changed
into
alarm
in
another
when
she
found
that
her
shoulders
were
nowhere
to
be
all
she
could
when
she
looked

an
immense
length
of
which
seemed
to

She
was
moving
them
about
as
she
but
no
result
seemed
to
except
a
little
shaking
among
the
distant
green
As
there
seemed
to
be
no
chance
of
getting
her
hands
up

She
had
just
succeeded
in

she
found
to

nothing

the
tops

did
not

they
went
on
for
some
while
in
Alice
was
just
beginning
to
think
to
what
am
I
to
do
with
this
creature
when
I

so
that
she

down

neither

she
felt
that
it
would
be
quite
absurd
for

to

she
set

felt
quite
relieved
to

she
began
thinking
over
other
children

who
might
do
very
well
as
and
was
just
saying
to
one

the
right

to

she
was
a
little
startled
by

a
few
yards
The

only
grinned
when
it

It
looked
she
still
it

long
claws
and
a

many
so
she

that

to

with

rather
as
she

whether
it
would

had
not

much
farther
before
